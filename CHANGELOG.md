# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

# Next

### Changed

* Several `Alamofire` types that are exposed through TRON API's are now implicitly exported to allow using them without needing to write `import Alamofire`. See `Exports.swift` file for a list of them.

## [5.0.3](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/5.0.3)

### Added

* `FileURLPassthroughResponseSerializer`, which can be used as a response serializer for `DownloadAPIRequest` when you are only interested in URL of downloaded file.  

### Fixed

* `NetworkLoggerPlugin` now correctly skips cancelled requests

## [5.0.2](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/5.0.2)

* Added `DownloadAPIRequest.perform(withSuccess:failure:)` method, similar to `APIRequest` and `UploadAPIRequest` methods.

## [5.0.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/5.0.1)

* `BaseRequest.headers` now default to `HTTPHeaders.default` to allow sending Alamofire default headers such as "Accept-Language", "Accept-Encoding", "User-Agent".

## [5.0.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/5.0.0)

## [5.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/5.0.0-rc.1)

### Added

* Better debug prints for `NetworkLoggerPlugin` when decoding using `Codable` protocol.
* `configure(_:)` method for `BaseRequest` DSL to allow configuring request with several changes at once.

### Breaking

* Plugin API that previously was called with `Alamofire.Data/DownloadResponse<Model, Error>` is now called with `Alamofire.Data/DownloadResponse<Model, AFError>` due to Alamofire changes to error handling.
* `performCollectingTimeline(withCompletion:)` method is now called also with `AFError` instead of `Error`.

## [5.0.0-beta.5](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/5.0.0-beta.5)

### Added

* Support for per-request Interceptors.
* Three different behaviors for building URLs: `.appendingPathComponent`, `.relativeToBaseURL` and `.custom`. Those can be set in TRON initializer:

```swift
let tron = TRON(baseURL: "https://www.example.com/", buildingURL: .relativeToBaseURL)
```

Or you can change `URLBuilder.Behavior` on per-request basis, using the new DSL:
```swift
let request: APIRequest<Int,APIError> = tron.swiftyJSON
    .request("status/200")
    .buildURL(.relativeToBaseURL)
```

Default behavior for TRON is `.appendingPathComponent`.

### Removed

* `URLBuildable` protocol. Please use different behaviors for `URLBuilder` instead.

## [5.0.0-beta.4](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/5.0.0-beta.4)

### Added

* Support for Swift Package Manager in Xcode 11
* New convenient DSL, that allows to convert this code:

```swift
func deleteSession() -> APIRequest<Empty, UnknownError> {
    let request : APIRequest<Empty, UnknownError> = tron.codable.request("session")
    request.method = .delete
    return request
}
```

into:

```swift
func deleteSession() -> APIRequest<Empty, UnknownError> {
    return tron.codable.request("session").delete()
}
```

Read more about other DSL improvements in [5.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/blob/master/Docs/5.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)

### Changed

* `URLBuilder` now resolves URL's using `URL(string:relativeTo:)` method, thus allowing more flexible url creation.

## [5.0.0-beta.3](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/5.0.0-beta.3)

### Added

* Ability to traverse json to any level when using SwiftyJSONDecodable.

### Changed

* Improved response serializer behavior for cases where requests were stubbed using URLProtocol.
* TRON 5 requires RxSwift 5 and SwiftyJSON 5
* `Core` is now a default subspec for CocoaPods installation method. To use SwiftyJSON, add following to Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'TRON/SwiftyJSON'
```

## [5.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/5.0.0-beta.2)

### Changed

* `ErrorSerializable` protocol changed to have non-optional initializer and to not accept `serializedObject`. It no longer can be used for additional object validation, but behavior should be more predictable and straightforward - `ErrorSerializable` should only be created if somebody (URL loading system, Alamofire or Model serialization) actually reported error.
* `codable` is now a lazy stored property instead of computed property.
* `CodableSerializer` API has been made open to allow easy customization in subclasses.
* `NetworkLoggerPlugin` now has a constructor that allows to easily configure it's behavior.

### Breaking

* Properties that worked with `Alamofire.SessionManager` have been renamed to `session` to be in line with `Alamofire` renaming of `SessionManager` to `Session`.

### Removed

* `TRON.defaultAlamofireManager()` method. TRON initializer now uses `Alamofire.Session.default` as a replacement.
* `TRON.processingQueue` property

## [5.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/5.0.0-beta.1)

TRON now requires:
* Xcode 10
* Swift 4 and higher
* iOS/tvOS 10 and higher
* watchOS 3 and higher
* macOS 10.12 and higher

### Added

* [Complete documentation](https://mlsdev.github.io/TRON/)
* `TRONDataResponseSerializer` and `TRONDownloadResponseSerializer` structs to encapsulate serialization of responses using closure.
* All test suite now uses `StubbingURLProtocol` to stop tests from sending network requests. Closes #21.
* Additional `JSONDecodable` conformances have been added for arithmetic types such as `Int8...Int64`, `UInt8...64`.

### Removed

* `EmptyResponse` type was replaced with `Alamofire.Empty` struct to not interfere with `Alamofire.EmptyResponse` protocol.
* `TRON.stubbingShouldBeSuccessful` property since now each stub directly defines it's behavior instead of global setting
* Conditional conformance of `Array` to `JSONDecodable`
* Convenience download methods on `CodableSerializer` and `JSONDecodableSerializer`
* `AuthorizationRequirement` enum. Please use `Alamofire.RequestAdapter` and  `Session.adapter` property to adapt request, when additional headers are needed.
* `HeaderBuildable` protocol and `HeaderBuilder` types. Please use `BaseRequest.headers` property of type `Alamofire.HTTPHeaders` directly.
* `ErrorHandlingDataResponseSerializerProtocol` and `ErrorHandlingDownloadResponseSerializer` protocol. Now, `ErrorModel` on all requests conforms to `ErrorSerializable` protocol, that contains initializer that allows to create it directly.
* `CodableDownloadParser` and `JSONDecodableDownloadParser`, replacement class `DownloadSerializer` has been introduced, it allows to create a data model by implementing `DownloadResponseSerializerProtocol`
* `UploadAPIRequest.performMultipart` method, because multipart upload is no longer a special case in `Alamofire 5`, please use `UploadAPIRequest.perform` instead.

### Breaking

* `headers` property of `BaseRequest` now contains `HTTPHeaders` type instead of `[String: String]`. Please note that along with `HeaderBuilder` removal TRON no longer sends 'Accept':'application/json' header by default.
* `APIError` is changed to be able to accept `SerializedObject` and is now a class with nullable initializer. Also, `DownloadAPIError` type has been introduced for download errors, that do not have `Data` in them, but have `fileURL` instead.
* `Plugin` methods that previously accepted `APIError<ErrorModel>` now accept  `ErrorModel` directly. Added `didSuccessfullyParseDownloadResponse` and `didReceiveDownloadResponse` methods.
* All concrete implementations of `DataResponseSerializerProtocol` such as `CodableParser` and  `JSONDecodableParser` now have only one generic argument - `Model` and are only parsing model type.
* `JSONDecodableParser` and `CodableParser` now have only one generic argument - `Model`, since `ErrorModel` is now moved to `ErrorSerializable` protocol, that does not depend on any particular serializer.
* `APIStub` has been rewritten from scratch to allow injecting only results of network request(`URLRequest`, `HTTPURLResponse`, `Data`, `Error` and `fileURL`) as opposed to actual `Model` and `errorModel` as well as definition of successful/unsuccessful requests. `APIStub` now is been attached to  `Alamofire.Request` when stubbing for this particular request has been enabled. Rewrite also allows plugin callbacks to be called more consistently for both stubbed and unstubbed cases.
* `rxMultipartResult` method on `UploadRequest` method was removed since `UploadRequest` for multipart requests in Alamofire 5 is now synchronous and now does not require special handling. You can now call `rxResult` replacement method instead.

## [4.2.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/4.2.1)

### Fixed

* `UploadAPIRequest` now calls `didReceiveDataResponse` plugin methods when sending multipart-form requests.

## [4.2.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/4.2.0)

* Implemented `JSONDecodable` support for Arrays, whose Element is JSONDecodable. Requires Swift 4.1 to work.

## [4.1.2](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/4.1.2)

* Improved output of `NetworkLoggerPlugin`, which now includes status codes, HTTP body contents, and some emojis ðŸš€

## [4.1.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/4.1.1)

* Allow `EmptyResponse` to be used with CodableParser when network response does not contain valid JSON.

## [4.1.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/4.1.0)

* Deprecate TRON level headerBuilder in favor of Alamofire.requestAdapter.
* Loosen CodableParser generic constraints to be able to work with `Decodable` protocol instead of `Codable`.

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/4.0.0)

* Compiled with Xcode 9.1 / Swift 4.0.2

## [4.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/4.0.0-beta.2)

* RxSwift dependency is bumped up to 4.0.0-beta.0, SwiftyJSON dependency is bumped to `4.0.0-alpha.1`
* Binary release is compiled with Xcode 9.0 Swift 4 compiler.
* Added ability to customize `JSONSerialization.ReadingOptions` for `JSONDecodableSerializer`. Unlike previous releases, no options are specified by default(Previously SwiftyJSON used `allowFragments` option).

To have old behavior that allows fragmented json, use:

```swift
let request = tron.swiftyJSON(readingOptions: .allowFragments).request("path")
```

* Added ability to customize `JSONDecoder` for `CodableSerializer` for both model parsing and error parsing.
* `CodableParser` and `JSONDecodableParser` are now classes, that are subclassible.

## [4.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/4.0.0-beta.1)

**This is major release, containing breaking API changes, please read [TRON 4.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/blob/master/Docs/4.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)**

* Implemented support for `Codable` protocol.
* `APIError` now takes it's localizedDescription from underlying `errorModel` if that model is `LocalizedError`, and from `error.localizedDescription` if not.

# Breaking changes

* `SwiftyJSONDecodable` methods are now prefixed with .swiftyJSON, like so:

```swift
// old
let request = tron.request("path")
// new
let request = tron.swiftyJSON.request("path")
```

## [3.1.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/3.1.1)

* Makes `NetworkActivityPlugin` always use API from the main thread(thanks, @mgurreta)!

## [3.1.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/3.1.0)

* Preliminary support for Swift 3.2 and Swift 4(Xcode 9 beta 6).

## [3.0.3](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/3.0.3)

* Prevent upload requests from being sent using `performMultipart` method if they are not of .multipartFormData type and vice versa, add specific assertions and error messages.
* Added `isMultipartRequest` property on `UploadRequestType`.

## [3.0.2](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/3.0.2)

* Improved SPM integration and CI scripts
* Added `validationClosure` properties on `APIRequest`, `DownloadAPIRequest` and `UploadAPIRequest` that allow customizing validation behaviour. Default behaviour, as before, is calling `validate()` method on `Request`.

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/3.0.1)

* Constructors on `APIRequest`, `UploadAPIRequest`, `APIStub` are made public to allow overriding in subclasses.

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/3.0.0)

### Breaking changes

* `dispatchQueue` property was removed from `Plugin` protocol. All `Plugin` events are now called synchronously to allow write access to objects, expecially requests. If `Plugin` requires any specific dispatch queue to run on, it must implement this logic itself.

### Bugfixes

* `APIStub` will now print error to console, if it failed to build model from file.
* `NetworkLoggerPlugin` will no longer double escape characters, when printing successful request cURL to console.

## [2.0.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/2.0.1)

Lowers deployment targets to iOS 8 / macOS 10.10

Required dependencies: Alamofire 4.1 and higher.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/2.0.0)

* `NetworkLoggerPlugin` now has `logCancelledRequests` property, that allows turning off logging of failing requests, that were explicitly cancelled by developer.
* Ensures, that `APIStub` always calls completion blocks, even if response is not successfully created.

## [2.0.0-beta.5](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.5)

* `APIStub` creation is deferred until `apiStub` property is called.
* `APIStub` `model` and `error` properties have been replaced with `modelClosure` and `errorClosure`, that are created in `APIStub` constructor. This is done to allow `APIStub` to function even if `APIRequest` has been deallocated.

## [2.0.0-beta.4](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.4)

* Plugin protocol was rewritten to contain generic methods and more information about what is happening in TRON ecosystem.
* `ErrorHandlingDataResponseSerializerProtocol` and `ErrorHandlingDownloadResponseSerializerProtocol` now have protocol extensions for default SwiftyJSON error parsing.

## [2.0.0-beta.3](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.3)

* `Parseable` protocol was rewritten to directly inherit from `Alamofire.DataResponseSerializerProtocol`. It allows us to have two generic typealiases - `SerializedObject` from `Alamofire` and added to it `SerializedError` from TRON.
* Fixed issue, that could cause completion handlers to be called on background thread.
* Use SwiftyJSON instead of forked SwiftyJSON3
* `parameters` property on `BaseRequest` now contains [String:Any] instead of [String:AnyObject]
* `processingQueue` property on `APIRequest` was removed.

## [2.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.2)

* Rewrite `Parseable` protocol using associatedtype.

## [2.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.1)

`TRON` 2.0 is supported on iOS 9.0, macOS 10.11 and higher due to Alamofire.framework required versions. Read [migration guide](/Docs/2.0 Migration Guide.md) for overview of API changes.

**NOTE** This release uses [forked SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/MLSDev/SwiftyJSON), and `SwiftyJSON3` cocoapod, because original repo has not been updated to Swift 3. In future release we hope to use `SwiftyJSON` cocoapod. [Link](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues/627#issuecomment-247761400)

### API changes

* `ResponseParseable` was rewritten and renamed to `Parseable`. It now allows creating models without using a constructor. Therefore, it's now possibly to use really any kind of mapper and make factory-like response builders.
* Success blocks on `APIRequest` are now optional and equal to nil by default.
* `MultipartAPIRequest` now becomes a part of larger `UploadAPIRequest` class.
* Introduced new `DownloadAPIRequest` class, that receives part of `APIRequest` functionality.

### Renamings

* Swift 3 API design guidelines have been applied to all API.
* `perform(completion:)` method was renamed to `performCollectingTimeline(withCompletion:)` to better match method internal behaviour
* `encoding` property on `TRON` and requests has been renamed to `parameterEncoding` and now has a different type - `Alamofire.ParameterEncoding`

### Removals

* `responseBuilder` property on `APIRequest` was removed, as it's no longer used when parsing received response.
* `JSONDecodable` extension on `Array` is temporarily unavailable due to issues with Swift compiler.
* `encodingStrategy` property on TRON was removed - please use `parameterEncoding` instead.
* `TRON.RESTencodingStrategy` and `TRON.URLEncodingStrategy` were removed - please refer to Alamofire 4 migration guide for details.
* `RequestType` enum was replaced by `UploadRequestType` and `DownloadRequestType` on `DownloadAPIRequest` and `UploadAPIRequest` classes.

## [1.1.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/1.1.1)

### Added

* Optional `progressClosure` parameter to `rxMultipartUpload` method for multipart requests

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/1.1.0)

### Added

* `stubbingShouldBeSuccessful` property on `TRON`, that allows setting up globally, will stubs succeed or not.
* `encodingStrategy` property on `TRON` instance, that is used to select encoding type based on HTTP Method.
* `encodingStrategy` property on `APIRequest`, that will be filled with `TRON` strategy on construction.

By default, for backwards compatibility reasons, we use ParameterEncoding.URL as a default strategy. This will change in next major release of TRON, which will use `TRON.RESTEncodingStrategy` instead. This encoding strategy uses .JSON encoding for POST, PUT and PATCH requests, and .URL encoding for all other HTTP methods.

### Deprecated

* `encoding` property on `APIRequest`. Please use `encodingStrategy` property instead.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/1.0.0)

### Changes

None.

If you haven't been following beta releases, please read [1.0.0 Migration Guide](/Docs/1.0 Migration Guide.md) to get an overview of new API additions and phylosophy behind some breaking changes that were made in this release.

## [1.0.0-beta.3](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta.3)

### Breaking changes

* `ResponseParseable` protocol reworked to only include single initializer instead of associated type `ModelType`. Therefore, all generic methods that previously accepted `Model.ModelType` type now accept `Model` type.
* Removed `performWithSuccess(_:failure:)` method, please use `perform(success:failure:)` method instead.

### Added

* Ability to create APIRequest with Array generic constraint, for example - `APIRequest<[Int],APIError>`

### Changed

* `ResponseParseable` `initWithData:` method is now throwable, allowing parsed models to throw during initialization. When initializer throws, `APIRequest` treats it as a parsing error.

## [1.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta.2)

### Breaking changes

* `ResponseParseable` protocol now accepts NSData instead of `AnyObject` in its constructor, allowing any kind of parsing, JSON/XML, you-name-it.

## [1.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta.1)

TRON 1.0 is a major release with a lot of new features and breaking changes. To find out more about philosophy of those and how to adapt to new API's, read [TRON 1.0 Migration Guide](/Docs/1.0 Migration Guide.md)

### Breaking changes

* `RequestToken` protocol removed, perform request methods now return `Alamofire.Request?` to allow customization. When request is stubbed, nil is returned.
* `tron.multipartRequest(path:)` removed, use `tron.uploadMultipart(path:formData:)` method instead
* `MultipartAPIRequest` `performWithSuccess(_:failure:progress:cancellableCallback:)` method is replaced by `performMultipart(success:failure:encodingMemoryThreshold:encodingCompletion:)`
* `MultipartAPIRequest` no longer subclasses `APIRequest` - they both now subclass `BaseRequest`.
* `appendMultipartData(_:name:filename:mimeType:)` on `MultipartAPIRequest` is removed. Please use `Alamofire.Manager.MultipartFormData` built-in methods to append multipart data
* RxSwift extension on `MultipartAPIRequest` reworked to return single Observable<ModelType>
* `EventDispatcher` class and corresponding `TRON.dispatcher`, `APIRequest.dispatcher` property are replaced by `TRON` and `APIRequest` properties - `processingQueue` and `resultDeliveryQueue`, which are used to determine on which queue should processing be performed and on which queue results should be delivered.
* `Progress` and `ProgressClosure` typealiases have been removed

### Added

* `upload(path:file:)` - upload from file
* `upload(path:data:)` - upload data
* `upload(path:stream:)` - upload from stream
* `download(path:destination:)` - download file to destination
* `download(path:destination:resumingFromData:)` - download file to destination, resuming from data
* `uploadMultipart(path:formData:)` - multipart form data upload
* `perform(completion:)` method, that accepts `Alamofire.Response` -> Void block.

### Deprecations

* `APIRequest` `performWithSuccess(_:failure:)` method is deprecated, new name - `perform(success:failure:)`

## [0.4.3](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/0.4.3)

### Fixed

* Allow `MultipartAPIRequest` to use any StringLiteralConvertible value in parameters (for example Int, or Bool e.t.c).

## [0.4.2](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/0.4.2)

### Fixed

* Prevent `APIRequest` from being deallocated if rxResult Observable is passed elsewhere without keeping strong reference to `APIRequest` itself.

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/0.4.1)

### Fixed

* Plugins are now correctly notified with "willSendRequest(_:)" method call for multipart requests.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/0.4.0)

### Breaking

* Update to Swift 2.2. This release is not backwards compatible with Swift 2.1.
* `NetworkActivityPlugin` now accepts `UIApplication` in it's initializer to be able to compile in application extensions environments.
* `NetworkActivityPlugin` supports only single instance of `TRON`. If you have multiple `TRON`s in your application, consider building another plugin, that uses static variables to track number of requests, similar to old `NetworkActivityPlugin` from `5639b960e968586d1e24a7adcc6a3420e8648d49`.

### Added

* Added `EmptyResponse` class that can be used for requests with empty body. For example:

```swift
let request : APIRequest<EmptyResponse, MyError> = tron.request("empty/response")
```

* RxSwift extensions for `APIRequest` and `MultipartAPIRequest`, usage:

```swift
let request : APIRequest<Foo, MyError> = tron.request("foo")
_ = request.rxResult.subscribeNext { result in
    print(result)
}
```

```swift
let multipartRequest = MultipartAPIRequest<Foo,MyError> = tron.multipartRequest("foo")

let (progress, result) = multipartRequest.rxUpload()

_ = progress.subscribeNext { progress in
    print(progress.bytesSent,progress.totalBytesWritten,progress.totalBytesExpectedToWrite)
}

_ = result.subscribeNext { result in
    print("Received result: \(result)")
}
```

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/0.3.0)

Completion blocks are now handled by new `EventDispatcher` class, which is responsible for running completion blocks on predefined GCD-queue.

Default behaviour - all parsing is made on QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED queue, success and failure blocks are called on main queue.

You can specify `processingQueue`, `successDeliveryQueue` and `failureDeliveryQueue` on `dispatcher` property of TRON. After request creation you can modify queues using `dispatcher` property on APIRequest, or even replace EventDispatcher with a custom one.

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/0.2.1)

Added public initializer for NetworkActivityPlugin

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/0.2.0)

Add support for any custom mapper to be used with TRON. Defaulting to `SwiftyJSON`.

Examples:

[Argo](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/blob/master/Custom%20mappers/Argo.playground/Contents.swift), [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/blob/support_custom_mappers/Custom%20mappers/ObjectMapper.playground/Contents.swift)

### Limitations

`ResponseParseable` and `JSONDecodable` are now Self-requirement protocols with all their limitations. Apart from that, there are some other limitations as well:

#### Subclasses

Subclassing ResponseParseable requires explicit typealias in subclassed model:

```swift
class Ancestor: JSONDecodable {
    required init(json: JSON) {

    }
}

class Sibling: Ancestor {
    typealias ModelType = Sibling
}
```

[Discussion in mailing Swift mailing lists](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151228/004645.html)

#### Multiple custom mappers

Current architecture does not support having more than one mapper in your project, because Swift is unable to differentiate between two ResponseParseable extensions on different types.

#### Arrays and CollectionTypes

Currently, there's no way to extend CollectionType or Array with `JSONDecodable` or `ResponseParseable` protocol, so creating request with ModelType of array(APIRequest<[Foo],Bar>) is not possible.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/releases/tag/0.1.0)

Initial OSS release, yaaaay!
