TRON is a lightweight network abstraction layer, built on top of [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire). It can be used to dramatically simplify interacting with RESTful JSON web-services.

## Features

- [x] Generic, protocol-based implementation
- [x] Built-in response and error parsing
- [x] Support for any custom mapper. Defaults to [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON).
- [x] Support for upload tasks
- [x] Support for download tasks and resuming downloads
- [x] Robust plugin system
- [x] Stubbing of network requests
- [x] Modular architecture
- [x] Support for iOS/Mac OS X/tvOS/watchOS/Linux
- [x] Support for CocoaPods/Carthage/Swift Package Manager
- [x] RxSwift extension

## Overview

We designed TRON to be simple to use and also very easy to customize. After initial setup, using TRON is very straightforward:

```swift
let request: APIRequest<User,MyAppError> = tron.request(path: "me")
request.perform(withSuccess: { user in
  print("Received User: \(user)")
}, failure: { error in
  print("User request failed, parsed error: \(error)")
})
```

## Requirements

- XCode 8
- Swift 3
- iOS 9 / macOS 10.11 / tvOS 9.0 / watchOS 2.0

## Installation

## Project status

`TRON` is under active development by MLSDev Inc. Pull requests and issues are welcome!

## Request building

`TRON` object serves as initial configurator for APIRequest, setting all base values and configuring to use with baseURL.

```swift
let tron = TRON(baseURL: "https://api.myapp.com/")
```

You need to keep strong reference to `TRON` object, because it holds Alamofire.Manager, that is running all requests.

### URLBuildable

`URLBuildable` protocol is used to convert relative path to URL, that will be used by request.

```swift
public protocol URLBuildable {
    func url(forPath path: String) -> URL
}
```

By default, `TRON` uses `URLBuilder` class, that simply appends relative path to base URL, which is sufficient in most cases. You can customize url building process globally by changing `urlBuilder` property on `TRON` or locally, for a single request by modifying `urlBuilder` property on `APIRequest`.

### HeaderBuildable

`HeaderBuildable` protocol is used to configure HTTP headers on your request.

```swift
public protocol HeaderBuildable {
    func headers(forAuthorizationRequirement requirement: AuthorizationRequirement, including headers: [String:String]) -> [String: String]
}
```

`AuthorizationRequirement` is an enum with three values:

```swift
public enum AuthorizationRequirement {
    case none, allowed, required
}
```

It represents scenarios where user is not authorized, user is authorized, but authorization is not required, and a case, where request requires authorization.

By default, `TRON` uses `HeaderBuilder` class, which adds "Accept":"application/json" header to your requests.

## Sending requests

To send `APIRequest`, call `perform(withSuccess:failure:)` method on `APIRequest`:

```swift
let alamofireRequest = request.perform(withSuccess: { result in }, failure: { error in})
```

Notice that `alamofireRequest` variable returned from this method is an Alamofire.Request?, that will be nil if request is stubbed.

Alternatively, you can use `performCollectingTimeline(withCompletion:)` method that contains `Alamofire.Response` inside completion closure:

```swift
request.performCollectingTimeline(withCompletion: { response in
    print(response.timeline)
    print(response.result)
})
```

In both cases, you can additionally chain `Alamofire.Request` methods, if you need:

```swift
request.perform(withSuccess: { result in }, failure: { error in })?.progress { bytesWritten, totalBytesWritten, totalBytesExpectedToWrite in
    print(bytesWritten, totalBytesWritten, totalBytesExpectedToWrite)
}
```

## Response parsing

Generic `APIRequest` implementation allows us to define expected response type before request is even sent. We use `Alamofire` `DataResponseSerializerProtocol`, and are adding to it `ErrorHandlingDataResponseSerializerProtocol`, which basically allows us to have two generics for both success and error values.

```swift

// Alamofire 4:

public protocol DataResponseSerializerProtocol {
    associatedtype SerializedObject

    var serializeResponse: (URLRequest?, HTTPURLResponse?, Data?, Error?) -> Result<SerializedObject> { get }
}

// TRON 2:

public protocol ErrorHandlingDataResponseSerializerProtocol : DataResponseSerializerProtocol {
    associatedtype SerializedError

    var serializeError: (Alamofire.Result<SerializedObject>?,URLRequest?, HTTPURLResponse?, Data?, Error?) -> APIError<SerializedError> { get }
}

```

`TRON` provides `JSONDecodable` protocol, that allows us to parse models using [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON):

```swift
public protocol JSONDecodable {
    init(json: JSON) throws
}
```

To parse your response from the server using `SwiftyJSON`, all you need to do is to create `JSONDecodable` conforming type, for example:

```swift
class User: JSONDecodable {
  let name : String
  let id: Int

  required init(json: JSON) {
    name = json["name"].stringValue
    id = json["id"].intValue
  }
}
```

And send a request:

```swift
let request: APIRequest<User,MyAppError> = tron.request(path: "me")
request.perform(withSuccess: { user in
  print("Received user: \(user.name) with id: \(user.id)")
})
```

There are also default implementations of `JSONDecodable` protocol for Swift built-in types like String, Int, Float, Double and Bool, so you can easily do something like this:

```swift
let request : APIRequest<String,MyAppError> = tron.request(path: "status")
request.perform(withSuccess: { status in
    print("Server status: \(status)") //
})
```

You can also use `EmptyResponse` struct in cases where you don't care about actual response.

There is also an array extension for `JSONDecodable`, however it's commented out due to [this](https://github.com/MLSDev/TRON/issues/17).

## RxSwift

```swift
let request : APIRequest<Foo, MyError> = tron.request(path: "foo")
_ = request.rx.result().subscribe(onNext: { result in
    print(result)
})
```

```swift
let multipartRequest : APIRequest<Foo,MyError> = tron.upload(path: "foo", formData: { _ in })
multipartRequest.rx.multipartResult().subscribe(onNext: { result in
    print(result)
})
```

### Error handling

`TRON` includes built-in parsing for errors. `APIError` is a generic class, that includes several default properties, that can be fetched from unsuccessful request:

```swift
struct APIError<T> : Error {
    public let request : URLRequest?
    public let response : HTTPURLResponse?
    public let data : Data?
    public let error : Error?
    public var errorModel: T?
}
```

When `APIRequest` fails, you receive concrete APIError instance, for example, let's define `MyAppError` we have been talking about:

```swift
class MyAppError : JSONDecodable {
  var errors: [String:[String]] = [:]

  required init(json: JSON) {
    if let dictionary = json["errors"].dictionary {
      for (key,value) in dictionary {
          errors[key] = value.arrayValue.map( { return $0.stringValue } )
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This way, you only need to define how your errors are parsed, and not worry about other failure details like response code, because they are already included:

```swift
request.perform(withSuccess: { response in }, failure: { error in
    print(error.request) // Original URLRequest
    print(error.response) // HTTPURLResponse
    print(error.data) // Data of response
    print(error.error) // Error from Foundation Loading system
    print(error.errorModel.errors) // MyAppError parsed property
  })
```

## Using Alamofire custom response serializers

Any custom response serializer for `Alamofire` can be used with TRON, you just need to specify error type, that will be used, for example, if `CustomError` is `JSONDecodable`:

```swift
extension Alamofire.DataResponseSerializer : ErrorHandlingDataResponseSerializerProtocol {
    public typealias SerializedError = CustomError

    public var serializeError: (Result<SerializedObject>?, URLRequest?, HTTPURLResponse?, Data?, Error?) -> APIError<SerializedError> {
        return { erroredResponse, request, response, data, error in
            let serializationError : Error? = erroredResponse?.error ?? error
            var error = APIError<ErrorModel>(request: request, response: response,data: data, error: serializationError)

            // Here you can define, how error needs to be parsed
            error.errorModel =  try? ErrorModel.init(json: JSON(data: data ?? Data()))
            return error
        }
    }
}
```

## CRUD

```swift
struct Users
{
    static let tron = TRON(baseURL: "https://api.myapp.com")

    static func create() -> APIRequest<User,MyAppError> {
        let request: APIRequest<User,MyAppError> = tron.request(path: "users")
        request.method = .post
        return request
    }

    static func read(id: Int) -> APIRequest<User, MyAppError> {
        return tron.request(path: "users/\(id)")
    }

    static func update(id: Int, parameters: [String:Any]) -> APIRequest<User, MyAppError> {
        let request: APIRequest<User,MyAppError> = tron.request(path: "users/\(id)")
        request.method = .put
        request.parameters = parameters
        return request
    }

    static func delete(id: Int) -> APIRequest<User,MyAppError> {
        let request: APIRequest<User,MyAppError> = tron.request(path: "users/\(id)")
        request.method = .delete
        return request
    }
}
```

Using these requests is really simple:

```swift
Users.read(56).perform(withSuccess: { user in
  print("received user id 56 with name: \(user.name)")
})
```

It can be also nice to introduce namespacing to your API:

```swift
enum API {}
extension API {
  enum Users {
    // ...
  }
}
```

This way you can call your API methods like so:

```swift
API.Users.delete(56).perform(withSuccess: { user in
  print("user \(user) deleted")
})
```

## Stubbing

Stubbing is built right into APIRequest itself. All you need to stub a successful request is to set apiStub property and turn stubbingEnabled on:

```swift
let request = API.Users.get(56)
request.stubbingEnabled = true
request.apiStub.model = User.fixture()

request.perform(withSuccess: { stubbedUser in
  print("received stubbed User model: \(stubbedUser)")
})
```

Stubbing can be enabled globally on `TRON` object or locally for a single `APIRequest`. Stubbing unsuccessful requests is easy as well:

```swift
let request = API.Users.get(56)
request.stubbingEnabled = true
request.apiStub.error = APIError<MyAppError>.fixtureError()
request.perform(withSuccess: { _ in }, failure: { error in
  print("received stubbed api error")
})
```

You can also optionally delay stubbing time or explicitly set that api stub should fail:

```swift
request.apiStub.stubDelay = 1.5
request.apiStub.successful = false
```

## Upload

* From file:

```swift
let request = tron.upload(path: "photo", fromFileAt: fileUrl)
```

* Data:

```swift
let request = tron.upload(path: "photo", data: data)
```

* Stream:

```swift
let request = tron.upload(path: "photo", fromStream: stream)
```

* Multipart-form data:

```swift
let request: MultipartAPIRequest<EmptyResponse,MyAppError> = tron.uploadMultipart(path: "form") { formData in
    formData.appendBodyPart(data: data, name: "cat", mimeType: "image/jpeg")
}
request.performMultipart(withSuccess: { result in
    print("form sent successfully")
})
```

**Note** Multipart form data uploads use `MultipartAPIRequest` class instead of `APIRequest` and have different perform method.

## Download

```swift
let request = tron.download(path: "file", to: destination)
```

Resume downloads:

```swift
let request = tron.download(path: "file", to: destination, resumingFrom: data)
```

## Plugins

`TRON` includes plugin system, that allows reacting to most of request events.

```swift
public protocol Plugin {
    func willSendRequest<Model,ErrorModel>(_ request: BaseRequest<Model,ErrorModel>)

    func willSendAlamofireRequest<Model,ErrorModel>(_ request: Request, formedFrom tronRequest: BaseRequest<Model,ErrorModel>)

    func didSendAlamofireRequest<Model,ErrorModel>(_ request : Request, formedFrom tronRequest: BaseRequest<Model,ErrorModel>)

    func willProcessResponse<Model,ErrorModel>(response: (URLRequest?, HTTPURLResponse?, Data?, Error?),
                                                forRequest request: Request,
                                                formedFrom tronRequest: BaseRequest<Model,ErrorModel>)

    func didSuccessfullyParseResponse<Model,ErrorModel>(_ response: (URLRequest?, HTTPURLResponse?, Data?, Error?),
                                                        creating result: Model,
                                                        forRequest request: Request,
                                                        formedFrom tronRequest: BaseRequest<Model,ErrorModel>)

    func didReceiveError<Model,ErrorModel>(_ error: APIError<ErrorModel>,
                                        forResponse response : (URLRequest?, HTTPURLResponse?, Data?, Error?),
                                        request: Alamofire.Request,
                                        formedFrom tronRequest: BaseRequest<Model,ErrorModel>)

    func didReceiveDataResponse<Model,ErrorModel>(_ response: DataResponse<Model>,
                                        forRequest request: Alamofire.Request,
                                        formedFrom tronRequest: BaseRequest<Model,ErrorModel>)

    func didReceiveDownloadResponse<Model,ErrorModel>(_ response: DownloadResponse<Model>,
                                                    forRequest request: Alamofire.DownloadRequest,
                                                    formedFrom tronRequest: BaseRequest<Model,ErrorModel>)
}
```

Plugins can be used globally, on `TRON` instance itself, or locally, on concrete `APIRequest`. Keep in mind, that plugins that are added to `TRON` instance, will be called for each request. There are some really cool use-cases for global and local plugins.

By default, no plugins are used, however two plugins are implemented as a part of `TRON` framework.

### NetworkActivityPlugin

`NetworkActivityPlugin` serves to monitor requests and control network activity indicator in iPhone status bar. This plugin assumes you have only one `TRON` instance in your application.

```swift
let tron = TRON(baseURL: "https://api.myapp.com", plugins: [NetworkActivityPlugin()])
```

### NetworkLoggerPlugin

`NetworkLoggerPlugin` is used to log responses to console in readable format. By default, it prints only failed requests, skipping requests that were successful.

### Local plugins

There are some very cool concepts for local plugins, some of them are described in dedicated [PluginConcepts](Docs/PluginConcepts.md) page.

## Alternatives

We are dedicated to building best possible tool for interacting with RESTful web-services. However, we understand, that every tool has it's purpose, and therefore it's always useful to know, what other tools can be used to achieve the same goal.

`TRON` was heavily inspired by [Moya framework](https://github.com/Moya/Moya) and [LevelUPSDK](https://github.com/TheLevelUp/levelup-sdk-ios/blob/master/Source/API/Client/LUAPIClient.h)
